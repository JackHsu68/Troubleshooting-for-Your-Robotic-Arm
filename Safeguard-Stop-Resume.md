# Resume from Safeguard Stop Status 

The Safeguard is a safety mechanism that detects conflicting signals from a dual channel input. 
When a discrepancy occurs, the system will enter and be locked in a safety status of Cat. 1 Stop. To resume from the safety status, follow the steps below:
1) Release all Safeguard switches  
2) Press the Reset Button when the button light is on. 
3) Let the dual inputs open and close again. At this time, the robot arm will be re-powered. The Indication Light Ring will have the light blue light on to indicate the Safe Start up mode. 
4) Press the Stop Button on the stick or pendant for about three seconds. The robot will perform the calibration action of the start-up process and return to the previous operating mode.
